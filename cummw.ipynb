    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Agent-based modeling** is a framework for modeling complex systems that focuses on **agents**, their individual behaviour, and the interactions between agents.\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows us to study the structure of potentially **very complicated systems** without necessarily needing to be able to compute answers analytically or even write down the full system.\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--In this workshop, we will look at an agent-based model of virus spread, applied to the wider Columbia University community.-->\n",
    "\n",
    "<!--The session is loosely related to the session by Prof Ton Dieker on discrete event simulation in that we will compare and discuss the strengths and shortcomings of the two modeling approaches.-->"

    "## What is agent-based modeling?\n",
    "\n",
    "Agent-based modeling works by building **simple, autonomous agents** that interact with each other over time. This allows us to build sophisticated models, simulate them, and then study the macro-scale, emergent behavior of large populations of agents. We can then modify the model and perform analyses to study how different rules or agent-level decisions change the outcome of the simulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a classical example used to study segregation: <https://ncase.me/polygons/>. You saw a bunch of examples last time in Ton's slides, a lot of the 3D examples were agent-based mdoels. Even computer games can be thought of as agent-based models!\n",
    "\n",
    "The power of these models is in their simplicity and ease of implementation, as well as the huge variety of different scenarios that can be studied. However, these come with some drawbacks that we'll discuss throughout the workshop, such as their computational complexity meaning we have to make various tradeoffs while modeling."

    "\n",
    "## The simulation workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "An important part of ABM (and any modeling regime) is the actual modeling part. We have to choose the right things to include in the model to make it accurate enough while keeping it computationally tractable. Once a realistic model is built, we can move to **control** by studying how controlling different parameters of the model might influence the outcome. For example, we might try out different rules to limit virus spread, such as reducing the number of students that go to class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll now construct a simple model of COVID-19 and play around with it a bit so you get a feel for how it works.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The model\n",
    "\n",
    "To illustrate the point of ABM, we will start with a very basic model. Often when modeling, we first make a simple model and then iterate on it. This is an important part of modeling.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will model students as the agents that interact with the campus environment, composed of classrooms and apartments. Agents move between classrooms (randomly) and apartments (initial random allocation, but then fixed). Disease spread is random through the population.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Agents (students)\n",
    "\n",
    "* There are $N$ students going to campus\n",
    "* Students live in one of $M$ apartment buildings, each apartment has $B$ bedrooms, and students are allocated randomly into these rooms\n",
    "* Every weekday (Mon-Fri), students go to one of $K$ (randomly assigned) classes and then back home\n",
    "* If a student gets infected on a given day, they become infectious at the start of the same day, then remain infectious for a randomly chosen amount of time between 7-10 days\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactions between students\n",
    "\n",
    "* During each day in class, the students have a probability $q$ of getting infected with COVID independently for each student in the same class that is at the time infectious\n",
    "* During each evening/night, the students have a probability $p$ of getting infected with COVID independently for each infectious housemate\n",
    "\n",
    "So for example if four students, $A$, $B$, $C$, and $D$ live together in an apartment, with $B$ and $C$ currently infectious, then each evening, student $A$ has probability $p$ of getting infected by $B$, and an independent probability $p$ of getting infected by $C$. Therefore the probability of $A$ getting infected by either $B$ or $C$ (or both) is $p(1-p)+(1-p)p+p^2$. Similarly $D$ has the same probability of being infected each evening.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a student gets infected during the day, they only become infectious at the start of the next day.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Questions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is this a good model?\n",
    "* What assumptions have we made?\n",
    "* How should we pick the parameters? (Of course things like $N$ can be chosen from data we have, but what about $p$ and $q$?)"
